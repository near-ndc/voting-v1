### Voting Body

Voting Body is set of human verified NEAR accounts constituting NDC.

Voting mechanisms as well as Powers, Checks and Balances of the Voting Body is described in the [NDC Gov v1 Framework](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/gov-framework.md).

- Propose and approve HoM **setup package**: a request to deploy funds from the [Community Treasury](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/community-treasury.md) to HoM DAO.
- **Voting Body Veto** is a special proposal to veto other proposal made by a house. When a HoM or CoA proposal will pass it must not be executed immediately. There must be an challenge period, where a Voting Body or the TC can stop the proposal execution by successfully submitting a Veto proposal.
