# NDC v1 Smart Contracts

In NDC v1, there will be only two mechanisms to vote: simple proposal voting and elections. Both are based on stake weight.

- Details about the Framework: [near-ndc/gov](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov).

This repository provides smart contracts for NDC v1 Voting Body.

ðŸ‘‰ [**Voting Process**](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/elections-voting.md)

### Voting Body

Voting Body is set of human verified NEAR accounts constituting NDC.

Setting a proposal will require a big bond of NEAR (to be defined).

The main purposes is Constitution Ratifications - passes when [NEAR Supermajority Consent](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/ratification-and-election-process.md#voting) is met.

Moreover, Voting Body can make the following proposals, that will pass when [NEAR Consent](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/ratification-and-election-process.md#voting) is met.

- Propose and approve HoM **setup package**: a request to deploy funds from the [Community Treasury](https://github.com/near-ndc/gov/blob/main/framework-v1/community-treasury.md) to HoM DAO.
- **Voting Body Veto** is a special proposal to veto other proposal made by a house. When a HoM or CoA proposal will pass it must not be executed immediately. There must be an challenge period, where a Voting Body or the TC can stop the proposal execution by successfully submitting a Veto proposal.

## TODO

- [ ] Decide about admin / gwg. Currently:
  - admin is a GWG DAO
  - only admin can create constitution proposal
